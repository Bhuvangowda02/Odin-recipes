    <p>This classic patty burger is juicy and flavorful, made with a perfectly seasoned beef patty, fresh toppings, and a soft burger bun.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sliced onions</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into four equal patties, making a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Grill or cook the patties in the skillet for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty and allow it to melt.</li>
        <li>Toast the burger buns on the grill or in the skillet until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers: Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom bun, followed by the patty with melted cheese, tomato slices, onion slices, and pickles.</li>
        <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise on the top bun and place it on top of the burger.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious patty burger!</li>
